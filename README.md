# KmpTemplate
This is an example project based on another template and following the instructions to create a new project here: 
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-multiplatform-getting-started.html

# Plan
I want to start out with unit tests for iOS, Android, and the shared code. 
Then I want UI tests for iOS and Android. 
Hopefully I can leverage one set of tests in Appium that will test both platforms
